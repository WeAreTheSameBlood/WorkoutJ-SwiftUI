#  WorkoutJ - Your journal for training and tracking progress

The application was created as an analogue to existing fitness applications, but without unnecessary features and without an overloaded interface.\
Target audience - people with more than 1 year of training experience who can independently create and follow a training plan.

The application has a local database (CoreData) with entities: Workout, Exercise, Set (in Exercise), Person, e.t.

The project uses:
- SwiftUI (iOS 15+)
- CoreData
- Notification API

The application does not have a rigid design pattern, but adheres to a structure similar to backend applications, with the separation of entities by functional affiliation (Services (DataWorkers) / Models / Views / Util, e.t.).\
In the future, to work with third-party APIs, the Adapter pattern will be implemented to bring different data types to a single form.
